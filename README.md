# GRIP-TASK-1
We are solving the problem of Simple Linear Regression for the Student's Reading Duration Dataset and predicting the particular outcome by inputting the hours of reading.

Prediction using Supervised ML
(Level - Beginner)
● Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.
● This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.
● You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool
● Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data
● What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?
